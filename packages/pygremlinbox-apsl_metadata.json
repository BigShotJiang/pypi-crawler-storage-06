Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\n        License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download\n        the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of\n        Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the\n        following:\n        \n        2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your\n        organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for\n        commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:\n        \n        (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other\n        proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and\n        keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and\n        \n        (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code\n        and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose\n        any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the\n        recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.\n        \n        2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally\n        distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered\n        Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also\n        meet all of these conditions:\n        \n        (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the\n        Covered Code;\n        \n        (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in\n        each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files\n        to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any\n        change; and\n        \n        (c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your\n        Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have\n        Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your\n        Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this\n        License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you\n        Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial\n        External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source\n        Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a\n        web site).\n        \n        2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code\n        (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must\n        include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,\n        stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License\n        with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.\n        \n        2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each\n        Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth\n        herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does\n        not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple\n        and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity\n        based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n        exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole\n        responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the\n        Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the\n        Covered Code.\n        \n        3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this\n        License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under\n        this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your\n        Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or\n        controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and\n        Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses\n        under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.\n        \n        4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed\n        by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such\n        instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\n        Code or any portion thereof.\n        \n        5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights,\n        express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require\n        additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.\n        \n        6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity\n        or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted\n        herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n        may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple\n        or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional\n        Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and\n        every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or\n        such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.\n        \n        7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time\n        to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has\n        been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under\n        the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of\n        any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the\n        right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n        \n        8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested,\n        or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or\n        loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and\n        agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.\n        THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF\n        ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"APPLE\"\n        FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES\n        AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES\n        AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n        PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND\n        EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED\n        CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE\n        OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE\n        COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN\n        APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge\n        that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft\n        navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure\n        of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental\n        damage.\n        \n        9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY\n        CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n        OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY\n        PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),\n        PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF\n        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n        In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may\n        be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty\n        dollars ($50.00).\n        \n        10. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service\n        marks, or product names of Apple, except as required for reasonable and customary use in\n        describing the origin of the Original Code and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n        \n        11. Integration. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.\n        If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed\n        only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\n        the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n        this License against Apple.\n        \n        12. Governing Law. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the\n        State of California, as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within\n        California between California residents.
