These terms do not imply\n        any other licenses.\n        \n        ## Patent Defense\n        \n        If you make any written claim that the software infringes or\n        contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license\n        for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If\n        your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends\n        immediately for work on behalf of your company.\n        \n        ## Violations\n        \n        The first time you are notified in writing that you have\n        violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software\n        not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless\n        continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,\n        and take practical steps to correct past violations, within\n        32 days of receiving notice.
