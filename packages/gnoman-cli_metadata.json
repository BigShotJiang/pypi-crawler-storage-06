Grant of License\n        \n        Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use GNOMAN **only if Licensee holds an original paper copy of this Agreement bearing Licensor’s handwritten signature.**\n        \n        No person, entity, or organization may use, copy, execute, or distribute GNOMAN without possession of such signed Agreement.\n        \n        ---\n        \n        ### 4.
