If You institute patent\n           litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n           lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the\n           Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any\n           patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall\n           terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n        \n        4.

Disclaimer of Warranty.  \n           Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\n           provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on\n           an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either\n           express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or\n           conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n           PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
