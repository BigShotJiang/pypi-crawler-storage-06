  "version": "1.0.15",
  "summary": "BioSynth is a synthetic DNA design tool that eliminates unwanted patterns from sequences using a biologically informed cost model and optimized algorithms. It leverages a finite state machine with two-base memory and dynamic programming to generate minimum-cost sequences that preserve protein function, respect codon usage bias, and avoid unwanted patterns. The tool provides both GUI and CLI interfaces for flexible and efficient DNA design workflows.",
